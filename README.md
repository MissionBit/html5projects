html5projects
=============

This is a repo for html5 projects the SFUSD teachers want to work on at the end of the week of classes.

Here are some sample projects to get their creative juices flowing. Once we get a sense of the things they are geeked about we can put a lesson together for the chosen or dreamed up project.
